Usage: ~FG.tictac [<user>|<#>|reset|show|say <speech>]

This command allows you to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with
another user.  Start a game by typing ~FG.tictac <user>~RS where
<user> is their name.  They will need to respond by typing the
same command, but specifying YOUR name instead of theirs.  Once
you have a game going, place X's on the game board by typing
~FG.tictac <#>~RS where <#> is the number of the grid spot. To
show your current game board, use ~FG.tictac show~RS.  If you
want to talk directly to your opponent, you can type a message
using ~FG.tictac say <your message here>

To reset or end a game, use ~FG.tictac reset
