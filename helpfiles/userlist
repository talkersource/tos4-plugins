Usage: ~FG.userlist [<flags>] [<start> [<end>]] [<level>]

The userlist command will assemble a detailed report about all the users
who have accounts on your talker.  Use the specified flags below to
determine what information is shown in the report list. Users can be
searched by an alphabetical range (A-Z) specified by <start> and <end> as
well as by a particular <level> (in number format, i.e. 1 = 'Newbie')
The command leaves a file named 'userlist.txt' in the talker directory for
administrators with shell access to use as they see fit.  It is
overwritten every time the command is run.

FLAG		DESCRIPTION

time		Shows accumulated login time in days, hours, and minutes.
last		Shows the number of days since a user last logged in.
sites		Displays the last site each user connected from.
email		Shows whatever the user has set as his/her e-mail address.
files		Displays which types of user files have been created.
flags		Shows Y/N for arrest, muzzle, and invisible status flags.
all		(The equivalent of using all of the above, except email.)

NOTE: Any combination of flags may be specified in any order.
      Put a space in-between each flag.  The 'email' and 'sites' flags 
      can NOT be used at the same time; whichever flag is used last will
      turn the other one off.  To see email addresses with the 'all' flag,
      set the 'email' flag before OR after the 'all' flag to turn off the
      sites shown with 'all'.
