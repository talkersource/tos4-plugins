Usage: ~FG.wizlist

This command takes no arguments.  It uses a simplified version of the
~FG.userlist~RS search engine to display a list of administrators in
alphabetical order.  This file is stored as 'wizlist.txt' in the talker
directory for administrators with shell access to use as they see fit. It
is overwritten every time the command is run for accuracy.
