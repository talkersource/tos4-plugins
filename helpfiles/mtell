Usage: .mtell <user1> [<user2>...<user9>] <message>

This enhanced version of the standard TELL command allows you to send
the same message to a maximum of nine users at once.  Simply type the
full or abbreviated usernames after the command, then type the message
all on the same line.  Your message will be delivered even to users who
are AFK or in the editor.

NOTE:   This command "parses" (processes) the recipient usernames from
	the first nine words you type after the command name.  It checks
	each word in order to see if it is a username.  The process
	stops at the first word that does not have a user match.  You
	MAY abbreviate usernames, but if the first word of your message
	is within the first nine words AND it is a partial-match to a
	username, the command will send your message to that person too!

	Ex:  .mtell MyFriend YourFriend go to the next room
	This -could- be sent to ANYONE who's username starts with 'go'
	~OLBE CAREFUL!!
