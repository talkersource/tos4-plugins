Usage: ~FG.fullsamesite <user>

Shows all users connecting from the same site as <user>.

Note: <user> is case sensitive!
Note: Many ISP's use modem pools, where each modem has a different
  sitename and a user can get a different modem each time. fullsamesite
  considers those modems as different sites.
