Usage: ~FG.samesite <user>

Shows all users connecting from the same site as <user>.

Note: <user> is case sensitive!
Note: This is an 'relaxed' version of fullsamesite, which only compares
  the sitename after the first dot. This should alleviate the
  problems with modempools mentioned in the help for fullsamesite.
