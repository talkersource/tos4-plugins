Usage: ~FG.usersfrom <hostname>

Shows all users connecting from host <hostname>. Hostname can
also be only a part of a hostname, then all matching hostnames
are shown.

There is one thing to be improved: the output does not pause
when a screen is full - I hope I'll get around to add that
sometime ;)
